            <h1>Developer journey</h1>
            <p class="aboutText">From a young age, I have been passionate about technology. In 2017, I pursued my dream of developing software with an internship as a software developer at Funkwerk KÃ¶lleda. During this internship, I began my journey by learning PHP. By 2019, I transitioned to C++ and microcontroller development with Arduino. The following year, I completed my first DIY project: a self-designed desk lamp.<br><br>
              In high school, I wrote a term paper on DIY smart home systems. Alongside a classmate, I developed a smart home system with its own voice assistant and compatibility with commercial products. We also created custom gadgets, such as weather stations, smart outlets, and lamps. For my computer science class final project, I developed a top-down shooter game using Unity and C#.<br><br>
              After high school, I collaborated with a friend to build a chat application with encryption using vanilla JavaScript. In 2021, I began studying Computer Science at the Ilmenau University of Technology but left later that year for personal reasons. In 2022, I resumed my development journey with C#, creating a password manager and several small Windows applications, before returning to web development to rewrite the chat application.<br><br>
              In 2023, I used Vue.js to develop interfaces for my smart home system and created two web applications: another password manager and this portfolio page. Later that year, I developed three multiplayer games using JavaScript, Node.js, Socket.io, and Vue.js, along with a Spotify playlist editor utilizing the Spotify API and a new backend for my chat application.<br><br>
              Since 2023, I have been employed at AbsoluteGPS, where I build internal tools like a meeting scheduler and availability checker that suggests solutions when conflicts arise. My most recent project is a cycling route planning tool.

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p class="aboutText"> My hobbies include cycling, producing music, speedcubing, software development, and photography. I find cycling to be a fulfilling physical activity that allows me to enjoy nature and stay active. Producing music gives me a creative outlet, and speedcubing challenges my problem-solving skills.<br>
              In my spare time, I engage in software development, finding satisfaction in creating digital solutions. Photography is a way for me to capture moments and express my artistic side. Additionally, I have a deep interest in philosophy, particularly absurdism and determinism, which offer profound insights into human existence and the nature of free will. This philosophical exploration encourages critical thinking and enhances my approach to problem-solving, both in life and as a software engineer.<br>
              I am also writing a book in the field of political theory, which has further honed my analytical skills and understanding of complex systems. The process of articulating and structuring my thoughts in writing has improved my ability to approach software development projects with a clear, methodical mindset.<br>
              Furthermore, my interest in sociology and psychology allows me to explore the dynamics of human behavior and societal systems, which aids in designing user-centric digital solutions. These hobbies and intellectual pursuits contribute to my personal growth, providing opportunities for self-expression, learning, and a deeper understanding of the world. They help me strike a balance between physical, creative, and intellectual pursuits, all of which enrich my skills as a software engineer and my ability to think critically and creatively.</p>
